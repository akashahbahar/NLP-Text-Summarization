Kuala Lumpur, September 15, 2025 — In a groundbreaking move toward smart city innovation, Malaysia has officially launched its first AI-powered public transport system, integrating autonomous buses and predictive traffic management across the Klang Valley.

The initiative, led by the Ministry of Transport in collaboration with local tech firms, aims to reduce congestion, improve commuter safety, and cut carbon emissions by 30% over the next five years.

“This marks a new era for urban mobility in Malaysia,” said Transport Minister Datuk Seri Amirul Hakim. “We’re not just upgrading infrastructure—we’re reimagining how Malaysians move.”

The AI system uses real-time data from traffic cameras, weather sensors, and commuter apps to optimize routes and schedules. Early trials showed a 20% improvement in travel time and a 15% drop in fuel consumption.

Public response has been enthusiastic, with many commuters praising the system’s punctuality and user-friendly interface. The government plans to expand the program to Penang and Johor Bahru by mid-2026.
